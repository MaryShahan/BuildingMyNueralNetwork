# BuildingMyNueralNetwork

demonstrating how to build your own neural network with Pytorch and word embedding!
This network is designed to create a story based-off several books that I've trained it on, and therefore I named it StoryTeller.
you will learn how to manually batch data, create a neural network class, and define the structure of your model.
introducing Pytorch which is a very powerful tool for Machine Learning and AI.
then validation or pre-processing of the dataset, which are also very important steps

Then, we'll learn how to define the training function for our model, as well as connecting to a GPU engine FOR FREE! GOOGLECOLAB>RUNTIME>CHANGE RUNTIME TYPE>GPU>SAVE

included lots of helpful code for checkpoint saving, checkpoint loading, loss plotting, and prediction.
Even though the model is not nearly as accurate as it can be, we can test it check how logical our predicted story is.
Feel free to experiment with different weights, batch size, embedding dimensions, linear transformations, activation functions, losses, optimizers and etc. as I'll be doing this on my end as well.
Once I reach a great accuracy with my StorryTeller, we'll go over this model in much more detail and tackle all the functions we didn't have a chance to build together (including validation and pre-processing).
In the meanwhile, you can use this code to troubleshoot your own models or build new models based-off the same principles and hopefully, this will give you a good idea about some of the processes involved in AI.
