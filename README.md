# BuildingMyNueralNetwork

demonstrating how to build your own neural network with Pytorch and word embedding!
This network is designed to create a story based-off several books that I've trained it on, and therefore I named it StoryTeller.
you will learn how to manually batch data, create a neural network class, and define the structure of your model.
introducing Pytorch which is a very powerful tool for Machine Learning and AI.
then validation or pre-processing of the dataset, which are also very important steps
